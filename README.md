# Predicting-Foreign-Exchange-Rate-using-LSTM


This Project is about the Prediction System that can predict the Foreign Exchange Rate for the given country based
on previously collected Foreign Exchange Rate value.

Then, I Performed exploratory time series data analysis to grasp the dataset. The data preprocessing steps include
handling missing values and data integration.

Applied supervised techniques via Long Short-term Memory(LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU) models
using Python, TensorFlow 2.0, Keras, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Used Root Mean Square
Error(RMSE) as a Metrix to evaluate the accuracy


The dataset is not owned by me. I got this dataset from Kaggle.
